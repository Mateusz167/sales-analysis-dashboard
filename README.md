Introduction to Sales Analysis Task
Project Context
In this hypothetical project, I am tasked with analyzing sales data for our company as part of my responsibilities. My supervisor has asked for a comprehensive data analysis to provide valuable insights that can support leadership decisions.

Key Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
•	Sales Performance Evaluation: Assess overall sales performance across different regions and time periods.
•	Customer Behavior Analysis: Understand customer purchasing patterns and preferences.
•	Product Trend Identification: Identify trends in product sales to inform inventory and marketing strategies.
Tools
To achieve these objectives, I will use the following tools:
•	SQL: Extract data from the database.
•	Python: Clean and preprocess the data if necessary, using Google Colaboratory for coding and data manipulation.
•	BI Tool: Create a dashboard that provides a concise summary of the analysis for my supervisor.
Dataset
To achieve this hypothetical goal, I will use data from the Northwind database. I loaded the database from the following GitHub repository: Northwind Database on GitHub.
Steps
•	Database Setup: Imported the Northwind database into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
•	Data Extraction: Created SQL queries to extract the necessary data for analysis. These queries are saved in the SQL_Query.sql file included in this repository.
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Used Python in Google Colaboratory to clean and preprocess the extracted data. The Python scripts used for this process are also included in this repository.
•	Dashboard Creation: Used a Business Intelligence (BI) tool to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the key findings from the data analysis. This dashboard is designed to be used by my supervisor to support strategic decision-making.



Expected Outcomes
By the end of this analysis, I aim to:

•	Provide a clear evaluation of sales performance, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
•	Offer insights into customer behavior, identifying key segments and their purchasing patterns.
•	Identify product trends and recommend strategies for inventory management and marketing.
Project Repository Structure
•	README.md: Detailed documentation of the project.
•	SQL/: Folder containing SQL extraction scripts.
•	Python/: Folder containing Python scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
•	Data/: Folder containing the cleaned data CSV file.
•	PowerBI/: Folder containing the Power BI dashboard file (.pbix).
